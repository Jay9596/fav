# fav
The perfect tool for coming up with a name for your latest project.

## What is fav?
`fav` is a command-line utility that generates all possible combinations of the string 'aaa' and outputs all
17,576 possible combinations of the word. Using `fav`, you can scan through
the output looking for a word vaguely similar to a word in the English language and
once you've found it, then you've found the name of your latest project.

## Why did you make this?
After failing to come up with a name for my new project, I decided to look for a
trend in the names of successful projects in the past. Soon enough I realized that
project names like git, yum etc. were short, easy to remember, and weren't words
that we used too often in the world of computing. Thus, fav was born (and named using itself).

## How do I use this?
Simply compile the project that consists of 1 C source file using one of the many
C/C++ compilers available then run the output.

## Bonus
If you find `fav` useless, then a bonus feature is available. With the `-r` switch,
you can output the combinations recursively creating a matrix-like window.
